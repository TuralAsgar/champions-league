## Test task

### Requirements

Insider Champions League: In this project, we expect you to complete a
simulation. In this simulation, there will be a group of football teams and the
simulation will show match results and the league table. Your task is to estimate the
final league table.

League Rules:
- There will be four teams in the league (if you wish, you can choose teams that
  have different strengths and you can determine the results of the matches
  depending on the strengths of these selected teams).
- Other rules in the league (scoring, points, goal difference, etc.) will be the
  same as the rules of the [Premier League](https://www.premierleague.com/tables?co=1&se=489&ha=-1)

![Premier League Table](/public/premier-league-table.png)

As can be seen in Figure 1.a and Figure 2.a, each screen of the subsequent week
will represent the league table and updated match status. Moving forward, both the
point scores and the results of the matches will be represented by this screen. In
addition, after the 4th week, your estimation will also be represented on this screen.
Limitations / Requirements:
- The Project needs to be completed using PHP (Projects that are completed in
  JAVA, .net, Ruby, etc. will not be taken into consideration.).

- You will be expected to use Javascript or its frameworks where applicable.
- Please deploy your Project and share your projectâ€™s access link. (Github,
